S CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT

S Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .

S Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .

S This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .

S The Factors that Shaped Biometrics

S Identification has become more and more important in our society .

S Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .

S Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .

S These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .

S Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .

S Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .

S The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) { Common Access Card } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card ] is a successful use of biometric identification .
A 24 25|||Wci|||example|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification ( Ben , 2008 ) .

S As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .

S Hence the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used ( Retinal Technologies , Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology , 2001 ) .

S The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .

S With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .

S This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government , the military , business and every individual .
