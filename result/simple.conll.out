CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .
Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .
This will , if not already , cause problems as there is very limited space for us .
The solution can be obtained by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems of lands that are inhospitable such as deserts and swamps .
Some countries are having difficulties in managing to get a place to live for their citizens as they tend to get overpopulated .
This has caused problems like the formation and growth of slums which most of the time are not safe to live in due to their unhealthy environment .
The only way to satisfy the increasing demands for space is by achieving a better usage of  land like designing taller building so the same area of land can accommodate a greater number of people  .
It is also important to use  better material that can support  buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
A good example is Japan , where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening  there .
Besides a better usage of land ,  better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people will need a clean environment to maintain their health .
For example , countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system .
Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage , but also to restore the land to a livable state and technology can help  in a number of ways depending on the quality of the land .
For example , countries with a lot of desert can transform their desert to increase their habitable land and use irrigation to provide clean water to the desert .
Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water . But it uses irrigation to bring natural water to the country .
Another example is Netherlands , where most of the land is  swamp under sea level . It has used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable .
As the number of people grows , the need for habitable environment is unquestionably increasing .
In this era , engineering designs can help to provide more habitable environment by designing  stronger material  to build taller and safer buildings and a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease , and also by changing the condition of the otherwise uninhabitable environment .
The Factors that Shaped Biometrics
Identification has become more and more important in our society .
Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .
Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .
These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .
Besides some technological determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .
Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies are concerned about .
On one hand more and more viruses and hackers can access personal computers , so  secret data and documents may be stolen .
On the other hand , some important departments need strict rules for their staff members over the use of confidential information to avoid information leaks .
The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) { Common Access Card } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card ] is a successful example of biometric identification .
This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification ( Ben , 2008 ) .
As we can see , the biometric identification employed in important security-sensitive areas is designed to identify people with accuracy and reliability .
Besides safety , convenience is also desirable for identification purposes .
We do not want to spend time and effort to remember passwords , and neither do we want to carry any cards or equipment to show our identity .
For government and other organizations , they are also looking for small size equipment  for identification .
Therefore nowadays  biometric identification process is designed to be very quick , and the equipment can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipment .
We can have a fingerprint verification reader combined with a built-in smartcard reader , and it only takes seconds to verify one 's identification .
Moreover , the society is looking for economic ways of identification .
Therefore , the equipment of biometric identification tends to be inexpensive .
For instance , Retinal Technologies , Inc. ( RTI ) ,  captures a retinal image at distances from the user 's eye with the means of just using a patented aspheric lens array .
Hence the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used ( Retinal Technologies , Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology , 2001 ) .
The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .
With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .
This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefits to the government , the military , the business and every individual .
All in all , biometric identification achieves great development as humans seek for better information protection , easier life style and greater economic profit , and it brings tremendous benefits to those who shape it .
