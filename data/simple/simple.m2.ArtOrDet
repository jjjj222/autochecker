S CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT

S Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .

S Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .

S This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .

S The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps .

S Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated .

S This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment .

S The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces .

S It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .

S A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there .

S Besides a better usage of lands , a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath .

S For example , countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system .

S Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage , but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have .

S For example , countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert .

S Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country .

S Another example is Netherlands , whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level , have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable .

S As the number of people grows , the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential .

S In this era , Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it 's possible to create a taller and safer building , a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease , and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment .

S The Factors that Shaped Biometrics

S Identification has become more and more important in our society .

S Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .

S Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .

S These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .

S Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .

S Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .

S On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .

S On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .

S The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) { Common Access Card } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card ] is a successful use of biometric identification .

S This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification ( Ben , 2008 ) .

S As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .

S Besides safety , convenience is also desirable for identifications .

S We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password , neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification .

S For government and other organizations , they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification .

S Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick , and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments .

S We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader , and it only takes seconds to verify one 's identification .

S Moreover , the society is looking for economic ways of identification .

S Therefore , the equipments of biometric identification tend to be in-expensive .

S For instance , Retinal Technologies , Inc. ( RTI ) , which captures a retinal image at distances from the user 's eye with the means of just using a patented aspheric lens array .

S Hence the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used ( Retinal Technologies , Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology , 2001 ) .

S The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .

S With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .

S This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government , the military , business and every individual .

S All in all , biometric identification achieves great development as human seek for better information protection , easier life style and greater economic profit , and it benefits much to those who shaped it .
